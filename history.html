			<h1>The History of SFPPP</h1>

			<p>San Francisco Peninsula People Power (SFPPP) is a non-partisan, grassroots civil rights organization,
				organized as a result of a nationwide event by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in March 2017.
				The People Power initiative was created to help volunteers build and strengthen local communities that
				affirm our American values of respect, equality, and solidarity. Our membership is located in San Mateo
				and Santa Clara Counties.</p>

			<p>Our two primary interests are in immigrant rights, and voting rights and outreach. We also have members
				working on civil rights issues like criminal justice reform, and law enforcement surveillance.</p>

			<h3>Immigrant Rights: a sample of SFPPP actions</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>We have met with local law enforcement, singly and with other rights groups, to lobby for People
					Power’s Nine Model State and Local Law Enforcement Policies and Rules several times. The current San
					Mateo County Sheriff says he is in compliance with SB 54, the California Values Act, but refuses to
					stop cooperating with ICE to the fullest extent legally allowed. We continue to explore other
					avenues to separate law enforcement from immigration enforcement.</li>
				<li>Members attended San Mateo County Board of Supervisors meeting to support Faith in Action’s efforts
					to encourage members to pass deportation defense funding for low income immigrants. This effort was
					successful and the Board approved $764,000 to fund deportation hearing defense.</li>
				<li>Participated in several rallies and protests opposing the Muslim Ban and the immigrant family
					separation policies of the Trump administration. SFPPP members, alongside other community
					organizations, co-organized and sponsored the Redwood City Lights for Liberty candlelight vigil on
					July 12, 2019.</li>
				<li>Distributed more than 1500 Family Preparedness Guides and more than 3000 Know Your Rights brochures
					to local churches, organizations, and individuals.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Voting Rights and Outreach</h3>

			<h4>Supporting Reclaim Our Vote</h4>
			<p>Reclaim Our Vote is a nonpartisan program of the Center for Common Ground designed to reach voters of
				color, and young voters, who have been or are at risk of being removed from their state’s voter rolls.
				Under guidance from Reclaim Our Vote, we have participated in phone banks and sent postcards to voters
				in states like Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, and Arizona so they are aware that their voter
				registration may no longer be valid, and know how to re-register.</p>

			<h4>Voter Registration</h4>
			<p>We have done voter registration outreach at community events, and worked with local high schools to bring
				voter registration events into the schools so young people age 16 and over can register or pre-register
				to vote while they’re at school. We have also done major outreach events on National Voter Registration
				Day.</p>

			<h4>The Voter's Choice Act (VCA) Education</h4>
			<p>San Mateo County implemented the Voter’s Choice Act (VCA) in 2018, a law which expands options for how,
				when, and where to vote. It includes the option to register to vote and cast a ballot up to and
				including Election Day. SFPPP worked to inform and motivate registered voters and potential voters to
				get out and vote using their newly available options. Members of SFPPP also volunteer on the county’s
				Voter Education and Outreach Advisory Committee, helping guide county outreach efforts.</p>

			<p>We have also outreach to communities with historically low Vote-by-Mail turnout, which would be most
				affected by the absence of small local polling places. Over three months we:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Worked with over two dozen community groups.</li>
				<li>Made 15 live presentations about the VCA.</li>
				<li>Hosted tables at 18 events where we registered voters and educated people about the VCA.</li>
				<li>Provided educational VCA materials to 27 other organizations and 40 former polling places.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Based on information from the Elections Office website, the VCA rollout looks like a success: there was
				significant increase in turnout for this past election, and a larger base of registered voters.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the June 2014 primary, there were 354,994 registered voters; voter turnout was 27%</li>
				<li>In the June 2018 primary, there were 388,298 registered voters; voter turnout was 44%</li>
			</ul>

				our attention, please email us at sfpeninsulapp@gmail.com.</p>
